# LOGJAM www/

The `www/` source-code directory-paths contains HTTP handlers.

The directory paths roughly correspond to the HTTP request-paths.

So, for example, the source-code path `www/ws/servehttp.go` corresponds to the HTTP request-path `/ws`

And, for example, the fictitious source-code path `www/apple/banana/cherry/servehttp.go` would correspond to the HTTP request-path `/apple/banana/cherry`

## Usage

To have all the code under this directory activate and work, something needs to `import` it â€” even if it is just for the side-effects.
I.e.:

```golang
import _ "github.com/reiver/logjam/www"
```

Note the underscore (_).
